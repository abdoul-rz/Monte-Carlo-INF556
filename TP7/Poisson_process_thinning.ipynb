    "The goal here is to experiment around the thinning of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. A Poisson process of rate $\\lambda(t)\\leq \\lambda_M, \\forall t$ can be simulated by considering a bound homogeneous Poisson process of rate $\\lambda_M$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- starting at $\\tau_{0}=0$\n",
    "- generating the event time $\\tau$ of the bound Poisson process of rate $\\lambda_M$\n",
    "- resampling this event as a true event with probability $\\frac{\\lambda(\\tau+\\tau_0)}{\\lambda_M} $\n",
    "- If $\\tau+\\tau_0$ is resampled as the event time of the true Poisson process, output $\\tau+\\tau_0$. If not, update $\\tau_0 = \\tau_0 + \\tau$ and repeat the previous steps.\n",
